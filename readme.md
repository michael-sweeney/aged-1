# AGED: Automatic Gene Expression Deconvolution

AGED is an R package which performs automatic gene expression deconvolution by utilizing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in a single pipeline function. Without any preprocessing or mathematical knowledge needed from the user's end, AGED is a ready-to-use deconvolution tool suited for all users regardless of mathematical background.

Furthermore, the AGED package provides the user with a set of visualization functions that provide a consistent, publication-ready aesthetic for displaying his/her/their deconvolution results.
